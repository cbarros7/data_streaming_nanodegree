## Description :speech_balloon:
This course is primarily aimed at building streaming-based applications using Apache Spark, Kafka, Spark Streaming and Kafka Streaming.


## Structure :hammer:
The following is the main structure of the program with the projects developed in each of them:  

**1.) Data Ingestion with Kafka & Kafka Streaming**:
 + **Objective:** Learn to use REST Proxy, Kafka Connect, KSQL, and Faust Python Stream Processing and use it to stream public transit statuses using Kafka and Kafka ecosystem to build a stream processing application that shows the status of trains in real-time. 
 + **Project:** [Optimizing Public Transportation](./Project/optimizing_public_transportation)

<br>

 **2.) Streaming API Development and Documentation**:
 + **Objective:** To identify components of Spark Streaming (architecture and API), build a continuous application with Structured Streaming, consume and process data from Apache Kafka with Spark Structured Streaming (including setting up and running a Spark Cluster), create a DataFrame as an aggregation of source DataFrames, sink a composite DataFrame to Kafka, and visually inspect a data sink for accuracy.
 + **Project:** [Evaluate Human Balance with Spark Streaming](./Project/evaluate_human_balance)

## Acknowledgements :pray:
Thanks to all the teachers, mentors and colleagues of **Udacity** who have been supportive in this nanodegree. It was undoubtedly a great experience both personally and professionally.
